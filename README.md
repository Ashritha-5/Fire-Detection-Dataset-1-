# Fire Detection Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on detecting fire in images using deep learning techniques. Initially, a basic CNN model was implemented but showed low performance. In the second phase, additional preprocessing and feature improvements were applied. Finally, transfer learning with pretrained models was used to enhance accuracy and overall performance.
